Agile Methodology
Agile Methodology is a flexible approach to project management and software development that prioritizes frequent delivery of small, functional software increments. It emphasizes continuous collaboration between customers and developers.

Agile Principles
Deliver early and continuously.
Welcome changing requirements.
Deliver working software frequently.
Encourage collaboration between business and developers.
Support motivated individuals.
Favor face-to-face communication.
Measure progress through working software.
Maintain a sustainable work pace.
Focus on technical excellence.
Keep things simple.
Build self-organizing teams.
Reflect and adjust regularly.
Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto outlines core principles for flexible, customer-centric software development:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
Working software over comprehensive documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
Responding to change over following a plan.
Pillars of Scrum
Transparency: Ensure that all aspects of the process are visible to those responsible for the outcome.
Inspect: Regularly review scrum artifacts and progress to detect any deviations.
Adapt: Adjust processes as necessary to improve efficiency based on review outcomes.
Scrum Values
Focus: Concentrate efforts on achieving sprint goals and delivering value efficiently.
Respect: Recognize each team member's contributions and promote mutual respect.
Courage: Tackle challenging tasks and make difficult decisions confidently.
Commitment: Stay dedicated to team goals and do what is necessary to achieve them.
Openness: Be transparent about work progress, seek feedback, and address challenges.
Scrum Roles
Scrum Master: Facilitates scrum processes, removes impediments, and ensures adherence to agile principles.
Product Owner: Manages the product backlog, prioritizes tasks, and represents the customer's interests.
Development Team: A cross-functional group responsible for delivering potentially shippable product increments during each sprint.
Scrum Process
Sprint: A fixed duration period (2-4 weeks) during which the team works to deliver a product increment.
Sprint Planning: A meeting involving the scrum master, development team, and product owner to set the sprint goal and select backlog items for the sprint.
Daily Scrum: A brief, daily meeting (15 mins) where the development team discusses progress and plans the next 24 hours, facilitated by the scrum master.
Sprint Review: A meeting at the end of the sprint where the development team presents completed work to the product owner and updates the product backlog.
Sprint Retrospective: A session for the scrum master, product owner, and development team to reflect on the sprint, discuss what went well, identify challenges, and plan improvements for the next sprint.
User Stories
User stories are concise, straightforward descriptions of a feature or functionality from the user's perspective. They capture requirements in an Agile framework, typically following the format: "As a…(user), I want… (goal) so that …(reason)".

INVEST Model in Agile
Independent: User stories should be capable of being developed and delivered independently.
Negotiable: Stories should remain flexible and open to discussion and modification.
Valuable: User stories should provide value to the customer.
Estimable: Stories should be clear enough to estimate the effort required for completion.
Small: Stories should be broken down into manageable sizes that can be completed within a sprint.
Testable: Stories should be written in a manner that allows for objective testing to confirm completion.
Velocity in User Stories
Velocity measures the amount of work a scrum team can complete during a single sprint. It is calculated by adding the story points of all completed user stories during the sprint. Velocity helps teams estimate their capacity for future sprints and plan workloads accordingly.
